Tunnel Studio played an integral part in Bellacor's recent growth. Tunnel assisted in Bellacor's brand development through logo
development, Web site design, Web site usability consultation, and
participation in Bellacor's brand identification process.

With the logo identity and Web site redesign in place we've posted a 71 percent revenue growth in 2003 over 2002. We attribute this increase in revenue growth mainly to the improved user experience. In addition to the strong growth our site has garnered many awards including the Internet Retailers Best of the Web, one the Top 50 Retailing Sites For 2003, and Best Web Site (Retail) by Twin Cities Business Monthly, October 2003 issue. Bellacor has also been named as one of the Top 50 Fastest Growing Private Minnesota companies by Twin Cities Business Journal (#12 to be exact).
