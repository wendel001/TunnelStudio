Dear Randy,
I wanted to thank you again 
for your great effort and service and helping us launch our Web site.

As you know, being a small company with very little expertise in the world of Information Technology, we weren't quite sure what we wanted or how to present our services to the market. Your experience and personal approach to our need was above and beyond our expectations. From the initial concept meeting, to the story boards to the launch, it was a positive learning experience for all of us involved in the project.

I would strongly recommend Tunnel Studio to any company looking for a new Web site. 
Your approach of listening first and designing second is apparent in the finished product.

Thank you again for all of your help and the manner in which you made Information Technology fun.

Respectively,

Scott Gallop
Communication Director
Twin City Acoustics
