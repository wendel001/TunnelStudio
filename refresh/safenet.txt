Through the course of the
last three years Randy Pierce and Tunnel Studio have provided design services to our company on a diverse set of projects. We've utilized their range of design expertise offered in a re-branding campaign for our company as well as facilitating our day-to- day creative needs.

Each project that I've been involved with I've found Randy and his group to be strong creative problem solvers. The body of work developed by Tunnel Studio has played a crucial role in communicating our cababilites and  service offerings to our clientele while reinforcing the mission, vision, and values of SafeNet Consulting.
