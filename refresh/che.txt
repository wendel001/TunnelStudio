var1=SAFENET THE COLLEGE OF HUMAN ECOLOGY

The College of Human Ecology is delighted with its partnership with Tunnel Studio to develop a new Web site. We hired Tunnel to lead us through the process of defining goals and strategies, developing information architecture, and creating and implementing new Web designs. Part way into the project we switched content management system vendors, but they didn't miss a beat. Their expertise in design and use of technology has been invaluable in helping to resolve issues in creative and innovative ways. The process has been highly collaborative and we've been impressed with how well Tunnel listens and finds solutions. The result-a highly customized and unified site that's highly functional, and has PIZZAZZ. It's been a pleasure and a privilege to work with the gang at Tunnel Studio.
